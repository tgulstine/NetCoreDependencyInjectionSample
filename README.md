# NetCoreDependencyInjectionSample
.NET Core Dependency Injection Example with a simple nLog implementation

This .NET project provides a simple illustrative implementation of dependency injection in .NET Core.

For teaching purposes, I consolidated all of the artifacts (Controller, Services, Interfaces, Models) into the HomeController.cs file in the Controllers folder.

The project also includes a simple implementation of nLog.
